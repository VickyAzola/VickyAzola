Welcome to my profile ðŸ¤—
I started studying code at the end of 2022, and I am constantly working on learning new things and improving my coding skills. Any advice is welcome!
Iâ€™m currently learning accessibility, TailwindCSS, Javascript, and React.js.

Check out my portfolio, where I show my programming projects based on front-end mentor challenges and UX design case studies.
