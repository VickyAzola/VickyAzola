I started studying programming at the end of 2022 and have acquired knowledge in basic programming languages such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript; in addition, frameworks such as React.js and Vue.js.

I'm certified in user experience (UX) design through the Google course on Coursera, in which I learned to make basic designs using Figma and Adobe XD for web pages and applications focused on the user and their needs.

I'm constantly working on learning new things and improving my coding skills. If you have some advice on how to improve my projects, please let me know!
